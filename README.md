I'm passionate about creating humane systems that empower people to do the work they love and find meaningful. I consider myself an artisan of code; I craft code. Clojure is my preferred language, but I believe in the right tool for the right job and will easilly apply Ruby, Java, Python, Javascript, and even Fortran to the task when I feel it is more appropriate. And of course, I use frameworks and libraries when they move the job forward quickly and effectively. I've looked to Ruby on Rails and React for much inspiration in how frameworks and libraries can work.

I have a dream of publishing amazing tools to empower software developers working on legacy code bases that helps them move their code bases forward into more modern practices of coding. I have a couple libraries out to help with this currently and use them in my own projects regularly. I really want to see software development move forward, but without throwing away the hard work of the past. I do not want innovation for the sake of innovation... we need innovation that offers real value, not a dopamine fix. Real value would be increased robustness, usability, security, performance (when increased performance is _actually_ a requirement and not another dopamine fix), and - something rarely talked about in the software community - longevity (users can tire of learning new things and this can also introduce human error into workflows).
